# Speech-to-Text Recognition with Accents

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a simple speech-to-Text recognition system that accurately transcribes spoken words while accommodating various accents and dialects. Accurate speech recognition is crucial for applications such as transcription services, voice assistants, and language learning platforms. However, many existing systems struggle to accurately recognize speech with accents, leading to errors and misunderstandings.

Our project focuses on addressing this challenge by training a model that can handle a wide range of accents and dialects. By leveraging deep learning techniques and datasets containing diverse speech samples, we aim to improve the accuracy and usability of the Speech-to-Text transcription process for individuals with accents.

## Features

- Accurate and robust Speech-to-Text transcription.
- Support for a wide variety of accents and dialects.
- Continuous improvement through fine-tuning and updates.
